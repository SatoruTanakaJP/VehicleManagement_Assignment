# 🚗 VehicleApp

## 🧩 Overview
This project is a **Java console-based application** developed as part of a university assignment.  
It allows users to create, manage, and display information about different vehicles, such as cars, trucks, or motorcycles.  
The program demonstrates key **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Create and manage vehicle objects  
- Display details such as type, model, and speed  
- Demonstrate class inheritance and method overriding  
- Simple console-based user interface  
- Modular design for easy code maintenance

## 🧠 Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Classes and Objects** | Represent different types of vehicles and their properties |
| **Inheritance** | Common vehicle attributes are inherited by subclasses like `Car`, `Truck`, or `Bike` |
| **Polymorphism** | Methods behave differently depending on the vehicle type |
| **Encapsulation** | Uses private fields and getter/setter methods to protect data |
| **Method Overriding** | Provides specific implementations for subclass behavior |

```
## 🏫 Educational Context

This project was created as part of a Computer Science course at the University of the People.
It demonstrates understanding of object-oriented programming, particularly inheritance and polymorphism, by modeling real-world vehicle relationships in Java.
